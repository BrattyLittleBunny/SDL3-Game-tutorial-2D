A Follow along project i did following "Zen" from youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUAW3gcAoZk&list=PLgBHxhPr3AsUlkPhMA9xgX_EyEmlwxcJd&index=1) AKA eneru2 from GitHub (https://github.com/eneru2)

Top down 2d game using SDL3 written in C. The tutorial was really good i think
Uses Tiled for the graphics
Unfortunately he never finished the tutorial ;~;

i plan on building on this for making a true game, but i'll do that in another file when i do :3

Assets in this are from https://o-lobster.itch.io/adventure-pack
is a free asset pack
i didn't include them 'cause it was to big and i couldn't be bothered with uploading them when you can download for free :3
Tiled is downloadable (for free) at https://thorbjorn.itch.io/tiled
